# Social Website Development README


This repository provides a guide to developing user account functionalities for a social website. The main goal is to create a platform where users can register, manage their passwords, edit their profiles, and authenticate themselves. Additionally, social features will be implemented to allow users to share images, interact with each other, and bookmark images from the internet.

## Features

- User Registration: Users can create an account on the social website.
- Password Management: Securely manage passwords.
- Profile Editing: Customize profile information.
- Authentication: Implement social authentication using Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Django Social Auth will be used, which supports OAuth 2.0 protocol for authorization. User profiles will be created automatically during social authentication.

## JavaScript Bookmarklet and AJAX Features

The repository includes instructions for creating a JavaScript bookmarklet, enabling users to share content from other websites on the social website. AJAX features are also implemented using JavaScript and Django, enhancing the user experience.

## Follow System, User Activity Stream, and Redis Integration

The project incorporates a follow system and user activity stream. Users can follow other users and receive updates on their activities. Redis, a fast I/O storage, is integrated into the project to store item views. Additionally, relevant optimizations and debugging tools are utilized to improve performance.
